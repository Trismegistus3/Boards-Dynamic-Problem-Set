Answer: <p style="color:white">A About one fifth of the iodides ingested with foods are selectively removed from the circulating blood by the Na+-dependent secondary active transport system that concentrates iodide in thyroid cells 30 to 100 times its concentration in the blood. Because radioactive iodine is essentially the same as iodide taken with foods, it is transported into the thyroid cells by the same secondary active transport system.<Br> </p>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white">A A drug administered subcutaneously will initially be located primarily in the extracellular fluid. In order to be absorbed, the drug must enter the general circulation; that is, it must cross the capillary wall. Capillaries have very wide fenestrae that permit the passage of molecules with a molecular weight as high as 30,000 daltons (D). Therefore, most drugs given by the subcutaneous or intramuscular routes will enter the general circulation by bulk flow transport (or filtration; also known as solvent drag) through capillary fenestrae. Moreover, insulin is a protein with a molecular weight of about 6000 D, so it cannot cross the capillary wall by lipid or aqueous diffusion through aquaporins (water channels) of cell membranes. Bulk flow transport is a passive process and is directly proportional to the pressure gradient across the capillary wall. It does not depend on the structure of the drug but only on its molecular size (both lipid- and water-soluble drugs can be filtered provided the molecule is not too large).<br>
B See correct answer explanation. C–E Facilitated diffusion, endocytosis, and active transport do not seem to be involved in the absorption of insulin from the site of injection. </p><br>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> C All drugs given by the oral route are primarily absorbed by the small intestine. This is because of the very large surface area of the small intestine, which is about 250 m2 and represents about 80% of the total area of the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrochlorothiazide is an acidic drug with a pKa of about 9, so it will be more lipid soluble in the stomach (where the pH is less than 2) than in the small intestine (where the pH is around 7). Nevertheless, absorption will take place mainly in the small intestine because of its enormous absorptive surface area.<br>
A Because a drug given orally is swallowed, the oral mucosa does not contribute to absorption.<br>

  <label for="other"> E. Most drugs are completely ionized in blood.</label><br> 
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> D Drugs may enter the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing the cerebral capillaries (i.e., from plasma to the extracellular fluid [ECF]) or by crossing the choroid plexus (i.e., from plasma to the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]). The composition of CSF is essentially the same as that of brain ECF, and there appears to be free communication between the brain ECF and CSF. In both of these cases, the drug must cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The main reasons that this barrier limits the transfer of drugs into the CNS are (1) endothelial cells of brain capillaries are connected to each other by occluding zonulae and do not have fenestrae, and (2) epithelial cells of the choroid plexus are connected by occluding zonulae.<br>
A, B These statements are correct, but they do not explain the low drug permeability of the blood–brain barrier.<br>
C Drugs are variably bound to plasma proteins; because the bound and free drugs are in equilibrium, even very extensively bound drugs can appreciably enter the brain.<br>
E Very few drugs are completely ionized in the blood.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> A The amount of drug reaching the portal circulation after oral administration can be strongly influenced by the dosage formulation. Because only single molecules of the drug can pass through the gut wall, the drug must be in solution in order to enter the intestinal epithelial cells. For example, a tablet must be disintegrated and dissolved before reaching the portal circulation. The efficiency of this process depends on several factors, including the way the tablet is manufactured and the excipients used. Once in the portal circulation, the drug can be metabolized by the liver, but the hepatic clearance will be the same, regardless of the different dosage forms. Because in this case the same dose of the drug was administered, the concentration of the drug in the portal vein will be directly proportional to the oral bioavailability of the different formulations, which is indicated by the different AUCs depicted in the figure.

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> C. 0
The net charge on aminocaproic at serum pH will be zero. Recall that when the solution pH is below the p Ka value of an ionizable group, the group will be predominantly protonated in solution. Conversely, when the solution pH is above the p Ka value of an ionizable group, the group will be predominantly deprotonated in solution. Normal serum pH is 7.4. The p Ka value of the carboxyl group on aminocaproic acid will be between 2 and 4 (typical values for carboxyl groups). This p Ka value is below the serum pH, so the group will exist predominantly in its deprotonated form, which for a carboxyl group is the negatively charged (–1) carboxylate ion. The p Ka value of the amino group on aminocaproic acid will be close to 9 (a typical value for an amino group). This p Ka value is higher than serum pH, so the group will exist predominantly in its protonated form, which for an amino group is the positively charged (+1) ammonium ion. Thus, at pH 7.4, the carboxyl group of aminocaproic acid will be negatively charged, and the amino group will be positively charged. This results in a net charge of zero.<br></p>
The structure of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is shown in the figure below. Naproxen has a p Ka value of 5.2, and its solubility is very sensitive to pH. What would be the approximate ratio of the ionized to unionized forms of the drug at serum pH?<br>

  <label for="other"> E. 100:1</label><br> 
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Correct: E. 100:1. The ratio of ionized to unionized naproxen is approximately 100:1 at serum pH. This problem is solved using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation,which allows us to determine the proportion of protonated and deprotonated forms of a molecule at any pH when we know the pK<sub>a</sub> value of the molecule’s ionizable group. In this case, the pH of our solution is 7.4, normal serum pH. However, because we are only doing an estimation for this problem, we can use a pH value of 7.2 in order to make our calculation easier. The pK<sub>a</sub> of the carboxyl group on naproxen is 5.2. Substituting in 7.2 for pH, and 5.2 for pK<sub>a</sub>.So, the ratio of A–: HA is 100:1. In the case of naproxen, the conjugate base (A–) is the deprotonated or ionized form of the molecule, and the acid (HA) is the unionized form (i.e., the structure shown in the figure with Question 4), so the ratio of ionized to unionized naproxen is 100:1<br>

While doing some yardwork at home, a teenage boy fell into some underbrush.

  <label for="other"> E. Sugar water</label><br> 
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> C. Soapy water.<br>
The boy would be best served by washing with soapy water. The goal here is to facilitate the removal of urushiol from the skin. The long hydrocarbon chain on urushiol makes it very hydrophobic or “greasy.” Soap, which is amphipathic, is able to interact with the hydrophobic urushiol and facilitates the suspension of urushiol. Furthermore, soapy water is basic, with a normal pH of about 9 to 10. The p Ka value of the central hydroxyl group on urushiol is close to 8. Because the pH of soapy water is higher than the p Ka value of this hydroxyl group, the group will be deprotonated and thus, negatively charged. This will additionally increase the solubility of urushiol.<br>
A is incorrect. Vinegar is 5 to 20% acetic acid and will have a pH value close to 3. Because this pH is below the p Ka of the ionizable hydroxyl group on urushiol, the group will remain protonated, thus decreasing the solubility of urushiol and decreasing the effectiveness of the wash solution to remove the hydrophobic molecule.<br>
B is incorrect. The pH of household ammonia is well above the p Ka value of the ionizable hydroxyl group on urushiol, so the group would be deprotonated and thus, slightly more soluble in solution than the protonated form. However, the increase in solubility gained by deprotonating the hydroxyl group will not be significant enough to facilitate removal of urushiol from the skin; the hydrophobic carbon chain provides too much non-polar surface area to be suspended in water.<br>
D is incorrect. Plain water will not dissolve the hydrophobic urushiol.<br>
E is incorrect. Adding sugar to water will have no effect on the ability of water to dissolve urushiol.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white">B Drugs bind primarily to albumin (if acidic) or to α1 acid glycoprotein (if basic).The extent to which drugs are bound to protein is highly variable (e.g., 0% for lithium, 99% for warfarin). Drugs ordinarily bind to protein in a reversible fashion and in dynamic equilibrium, according to the law of mass action, as shown by the equation
<br>
[Free drug] + [Protein] ⇄ [Drug–protein complex]
<br>
Mass action kinetics predicts that a constant percentage of the drug is bound; therefore, binding is independent of the dose (i.e., the kinetics of binding is first order).

The man reported that he had eaten some canned food from a local vendor the previous day. After a physical examination, a presumptive diagnosis of botulism was made. It is known that botulinum toxin causes paralysis by getting inside the axon terminals of motor nerves, where it inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin is a protein with a molecular weight greater than 100,000 daltons. Which of the following permeation processes most likely accounts for the transfer of the toxin through the nerve cell membrane?<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> D Very large molecules cannot permeate cell membranes by diffusion or filtration. The only way they can cross cell membranes is by endocytosis, a process by which a substance is bound to the cell surface, engulfed by the cell membrane, and carried into the cytosol, where the substance can be released by breakdown of the vesicle membrane.</p><br>
 A 69-year-old woman was brought to a local hospital emergency department by her son, who reported that his mother was found lethargic, disoriented, and combative a few hours earlier. Additional history revealed that she had ingested a large number of aspirin tablets in a suicide attempt. An appropriate therapy was instituted, which included the administration of sodium bicarbonate to increase the elimination of salicylate. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of this increased elimination?<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> D Aspirin is an acidic drug. As a rule, the excretion of an acidic drug can be accelerated by alkalinizing the urine, because an acidic drug dissociates to its charged, polar form in alkaline solution. This form, being water soluble, is “trapped” in the tubular lumen and cannot be transported back into the blood across the renal tubular cells. Conversely, the urinary excretion of a weak base may be accelerated by acidifying the urine.<br>
A Salicylates do not undergo active transport.<br>
B Salicylate biotransformation by the kidney is negligible.<br>
C Aspirin was already absorbed, so bioavailability is not relevant.<br>
E Glomerular filtration of a drug is strictly related to the renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is very rare for drugs to significantly increase GFR.<br></p>

  An 85-year-old man was recently admitted to a nursing facility. Diseases listed in his medical record on admission were depression with anxiety symptoms, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis. Medications taken orally by the patient included the following:<br>
Sertraline (base, pKa = 9.5)<br>
Diazepam (base, pKa = 3.0)<br>
Amiodarone (base, pKa = 7.4)<br>
Theophylline (acid, pKa = 8.8)<br>
Ibuprofen (acid, pKa 4.8)<br>
  Shortly after administration, which of the following drugs was most likely concentrated inside the patient’s gastric cells?<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts that a weak acid will be more nonionized, and therefore more lipid soluble, when pKa is greater than pH. Because the pH of the stomach lumen is less than 2, ibuprofen, an acid drug with a pKa of 4.8, will be mainly nonionized in the gastric lumen and will readily penetrate the gastric mucosal cell membranes. Inside the mucosal cells, however, the pH is about 7, and the drug will become mainly ionized because now the pKa is less than the pH. Consequently, the concentration gradient of the nonionized, lipid-soluble form will remain high, and the drug will continue crossing cell membranes. At equilibrium, the concentration of the nonionized moiety of the drug will be the same on both sides, but the concentration of the ionized moiety inside the cell can be 15 to 20 times higher than that in the gastric lumen, as the ionized moiety is “trapped” inside the cell (ion-trapping mechanism). Therefore, the total drug concentration inside the cell will be high.<br>
A–C Basic drugs are mainly ionized when the pKa is higher than the pH; therefore, most of the drug will stay in the stomach lumen. <br>
D Theophylline, an acidic drug with a pKa of 8.8, is mainly nonionized in the stomach lumen and therefore can readily penetrate the gastric cell membranes. Inside the gastric cells, however, the drug remains mainly non-nonionized (i.e., lipid soluble) because the pKa is greater than the pH. Therefore, the drug will be able to diffuse through the basolateral membrane of the cell, thus reaching the extracellular fluids. No ion trapping occurs, and the drug will not concentrate inside the cells.<br>
