Answer: <p style="color:white"> B Lipid diffusion is by far the most common transport system of drugs across cell membranes. Because albuterol has a low molecular weight, lipid diffusion most likely accounts for the transfer of albuterol through the bronchial mucosa.</p>

Answer: <p style="color:white">A About one fifth of the iodides ingested with foods are selectively removed from the circulating blood by the Na+-dependent secondary active transport system that concentrates iodide in thyroid cells 30 to 100 times its concentration in the blood. Because radioactive iodine is essentially the same as iodide taken with foods, it is transported into the thyroid cells by the same secondary active transport system.<Br> </p>

  A 12-year-old boy recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes started a therapy with two daily subcutaneous administrations of insulin. Which of the following permeation processes best explains the absorption of insulin from the site of injection?<br>

  <label for="other"> E. Active transport</label><br>
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white">A A drug administered subcutaneously will initially be located primarily in the extracellular fluid. In order to be absorbed, the drug must enter the general circulation; that is, it must cross the capillary wall. Capillaries have very wide fenestrae that permit the passage of molecules with a molecular weight as high as 30,000 daltons (D). Therefore, most drugs given by the subcutaneous or intramuscular routes will enter the general circulation by bulk flow transport (or filtration; also known as solvent drag) through capillary fenestrae. Moreover, insulin is a protein with a molecular weight of about 6000 D, so it cannot cross the capillary wall by lipid or aqueous diffusion through aquaporins (water channels) of cell membranes. Bulk flow transport is a passive process and is directly proportional to the pressure gradient across the capillary wall. It does not depend on the structure of the drug but only on its molecular size (both lipid- and water-soluble drugs can be filtered provided the molecule is not too large).<br>
B See correct answer explanation. C–E Facilitated diffusion, endocytosis, and active transport do not seem to be involved in the absorption of insulin from the site of injection. </p><br>

<br>A 63-year old man recently diagnosed with hypertension started a therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, one tablet daily. Hydrochlorothiazide is an acidic drug with a pKa of about 9. Which of the following parts of the digestive tract most likely represents the main site of absorption of that drug?<br>

  <label for="other"> E. Rectum</label><br> 
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> C All drugs given by the oral route are primarily absorbed by the small intestine. This is because of the very large surface area of the small intestine, which is about 250 m2 and represents about 80% of the total area of the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrochlorothiazide is an acidic drug with a pKa of about 9, so it will be more lipid soluble in the stomach (where the pH is less than 2) than in the small intestine (where the pH is around 7). Nevertheless, absorption will take place mainly in the small intestine because of its enormous absorptive surface area.<br>
A Because a drug given orally is swallowed, the oral mucosa does not contribute to absorption.<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> A The amount of drug reaching the portal circulation after oral administration can be strongly influenced by the dosage formulation. Because only single molecules of the drug can pass through the gut wall, the drug must be in solution in order to enter the intestinal epithelial cells. For example, a tablet must be disintegrated and dissolved before reaching the portal circulation. The efficiency of this process depends on several factors, including the way the tablet is manufactured and the excipients used. Once in the portal circulation, the drug can be metabolized by the liver, but the hepatic clearance will be the same, regardless of the different dosage forms. Because in this case the same dose of the drug was administered, the concentration of the drug in the portal vein will be directly proportional to the oral bioavailability of the different formulations, which is indicated by the different AUCs depicted in the figure.

   A 34-year-old man on vacation in Mexico was admitted to the hospital because of vomiting, double vision, and muscular paralysis. The man reported that he had eaten some canned food from a local vendor the previous day. After a physical examination, a presumptive diagnosis of botulism was made. It is known that botulinum toxin causes paralysis by getting inside the axon terminals of motor nerves, where it inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin is a protein with a molecular weight greater than 100,000 daltons. Which of the following permeation processes most likely accounts for the transfer of the toxin through the nerve cell membrane?<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> D Very large molecules cannot permeate cell membranes by diffusion or filtration. The only way they can cross cell membranes is by endocytosis, a process by which a substance is bound to the cell surface, engulfed by the cell membrane, and carried into the cytosol, where the substance can be released by breakdown of the vesicle membrane.</p><br>
 A 69-year-old woman was brought to a local hospital emergency department by her son, who reported that his mother was found lethargic, disoriented, and combative a few hours earlier. Additional history revealed that she had ingested a large number of aspirin tablets in a suicide attempt. An appropriate therapy was instituted, which included the administration of sodium bicarbonate to increase the elimination of salicylate. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of this increased elimination?<br>

  <label for="other"> E. Increased glomerular filtration of salicylate</label><br>
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> D Aspirin is an acidic drug. As a rule, the excretion of an acidic drug can be accelerated by alkalinizing the urine, because an acidic drug dissociates to its charged, polar form in alkaline solution. This form, being water soluble, is “trapped” in the tubular lumen and cannot be transported back into the blood across the renal tubular cells. Conversely, the urinary excretion of a weak base may be accelerated by acidifying the urine.<br>
A Salicylates do not undergo active transport.<br>
B Salicylate biotransformation by the kidney is negligible.<br>
C Aspirin was already absorbed, so bioavailability is not relevant.<br>
E Glomerular filtration of a drug is strictly related to the renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is very rare for drugs to significantly increase GFR.<br></p>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts that a weak acid will be more nonionized, and therefore more lipid soluble, when pKa is greater than pH. Because the pH of the stomach lumen is less than 2, ibuprofen, an acid drug with a pKa of 4.8, will be mainly nonionized in the gastric lumen and will readily penetrate the gastric mucosal cell membranes. Inside the mucosal cells, however, the pH is about 7, and the drug will become mainly ionized because now the pKa is less than the pH. Consequently, the concentration gradient of the nonionized, lipid-soluble form will remain high, and the drug will continue crossing cell membranes. At equilibrium, the concentration of the nonionized moiety of the drug will be the same on both sides, but the concentration of the ionized moiety inside the cell can be 15 to 20 times higher than that in the gastric lumen, as the ionized moiety is “trapped” inside the cell (ion-trapping mechanism). Therefore, the total drug concentration inside the cell will be high.<br>
A–C Basic drugs are mainly ionized when the pKa is higher than the pH; therefore, most of the drug will stay in the stomach lumen. <br>
D Theophylline, an acidic drug with a pKa of 8.8, is mainly nonionized in the stomach lumen and therefore can readily penetrate the gastric cell membranes. Inside the gastric cells, however, the drug remains mainly non-nonionized (i.e., lipid soluble) because the pKa is greater than the pH. Therefore, the drug will be able to diffuse through the basolateral membrane of the cell, thus reaching the extracellular fluids. No ion trapping occurs, and the drug will not concentrate inside the cells.<br>
