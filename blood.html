  <b>Cardiovascular Chest Pain</b>
<Br>
  A patient tells you he has paroxysmic atrial fibrillation. Which symptoms would you expect him to report?
<form>
  <input type="radio" id="A" name="1" value="A">
  <label for="male"> A. Occasionally, symptoms appear to come and go and not last more than an hour. </label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="B" name="1" value="B">
  <label for="female"> B. He seems to have symptoms constantly and this is the reason that he came back to the doctor.</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="C" name="1" value="C">
  <label for="other"> C. He is currently in treatment for atrial fibrillation and it is under control.</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="D" name="1" value="D">
  <label for="other"> D. None of the above.</label><br>
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white">A - In medicine, when a condition is noted as paroxysmal, it means that the condition is not constant and that it occurs occasionally with symptoms that come and go and tend to not last that long. The symptoms and condition may resolve themselves without medical intervention. Medical intervention can shorten the symptoms and/or decrease the amount of times the symptoms occur.</p>

  Which of the following segments of an EKG can remain abnormal weeks to months after an acute myocardial infarction?
  <br>
 <form>
  <input type="radio" id="A" name="1" value="A">
  <label for="male"> A. Q </label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="B" name="1" value="B">
  <label for="female"> B. P</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="C" name="1" value="C">
  <label for="other"> C. T</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="D" name="1" value="D">
  <label for="other"> D. ST</label><br>
</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white">A - In an acute myocardial infarction, the EKG changes over time. The initial changes are shown in ST segment elevation, which decreases over time to appear normal again. Weeks to months after an acute myocardial infarction, the Q wave can stay decreased. In the same time frame, the P and T waves tend to go back to an almost near normal quality.<br>
