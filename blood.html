Answer: <p style="color:white">A - In an acute myocardial infarction, the EKG changes over time. The initial changes are shown in ST segment elevation, which decreases over time to appear normal again. Weeks to months after an acute myocardial infarction, the Q wave can stay decreased. In the same time frame, the P and T waves tend to go back to an almost near normal quality.<br>
