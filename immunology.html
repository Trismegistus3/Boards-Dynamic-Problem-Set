  <h2>Normal processes</h2><br>
Development of cells of the adaptive immune response, including positive and negative selection during immune development<br>
  <b>Structure, production, and function</b><br>
<i>granulocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells, cell receptors (eg, complement receptors and toll-like receptors), cytokines, chemokines</i><br>
<i>T lymphocytes, including T-lymphocyte receptors, accessory molecules (eg, CD3, CD4, CD8, B7), cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and memory T
  lymphocytes</i> <br>
<i>B lymphocytes and plasma cells, including B-lymphocyte receptors, immunoglobulins, cell activation and proliferation, including development of antibodies and memory B
  lymphocytes </i><br>
<i>Host defense mechanisms, host barriers to infection, mucosal immunity (eg, gutassociated lymphoid tissue and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue), anatomical locations of T and B lymphocytes</i><br>
  <b>Cellular basis of the immune response and immunologic mediators</b><br>
<i>Antigen processing and presentation in the context of MHC I and MHC II molecules (eg, TAP, beta-2 microglobulin), intracellular pathways, mechanisms by which MHC is
expressed on the surface; including distribution of MHC I and MHC II on different cells, mechanisms of MHC I and MHC II deficiencies, and the genetics of MHC regulation of the adaptive immune response (eg, peripheral tolerance, anergy, regulatory T lymphocytes, termination of immune response, and B-T lymphocyte interactions)</i><br>
  <i>Activation, function, and molecular biology of complement (eg, anaphylatoxins)</i><br>
  <i> Functional and molecular biology of cytokines (eg, IL 1-15)</i><br>
  <b> Basis of immunologic diagnostics</b><br>
  <i>Antigen-antibody reactions used for diagnostic purposes, ELISA, immunoblotting, antigen-antibody changes over time, ABO typing)</i><br>
<b>Principles of immunologic protection</b><br>
  <i>Vaccine production and mechanisms of vaccine action</i><br>
<i> biologically active antibodies (eg, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies including IVIG, VZIG, rabies immunoglobulin)</i><br>
  <i> Effect of age on the function of components of the immune system</i><br>
<h2>Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, Prognosis</h2><br>
  <b>Disorders associated with immunodeficiency</b><br>
<i>Deficiency primarily of humoral immunity: common variable immunodeficiency; hyper IgM syndrome; hypogammaglobulinemia/agammaglobulinemia, X-linked (Bruton); selective immunodeficiency (eg, IgA, IgM, IgE)</i><br>
<i>Deficiency/dysfunction primarily of cell-mediated immunity: adenosine deaminase deficiency; DiGeorge syndrome; severe combined immunodeficiency disease
  (SCID); Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; granulomatosis; allergic reactions/skin</i><br>
<i> Complement deficiency: alternative pathway component deficiency (C2, C3b, C3bB, C36B6); classical pathway component deficiency (C1q, C1r, C1-C5); terminal component deficiency (C5b-C9; terminal complement complex); C1 esterase</i><br>
<i>Inhibitor deficiency, hereditary angioedema; mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency; membrane attack complex deficiency</i><br>
<i>Deficiency of phagocytic cells and natural killer cells: Chediak-Higashi disease; chronic granulomatous disease and other disorders of phagocytosis; leukocyte adhesion deficiency</i><br>
<i>HIV/AIDS: HIV1 and HIV2; AIDS; AIDS complications (eg, neuropathy, dementia, renal insufficiency); immunology of AIDS; immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS);
  secondary infections; noninfectious complications</i><br>
  <b>Immunologically mediated disorders</b><br>
<i>hypersensitivity reactions: type 1, 2, 3, including anaphylaxis; type 4; drug reactions; serum sickness</i><br>
  <i> transplantation: rejection; graft-vs-host disease</i><br>
  <i>acute rheumatic fever; autoimmune
arteritis/vasculitis; Behçet syndrome; Churg-Strauss syndrome; eosinophilic
granuloma, histiocytosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis; Goodpasture syndrome;
Henoch-Schönlein purpura; Kawasaki disease; mixed connective tissue disease;
polyangiitis; polyarteritis nodosa; polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, type 1;
polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis; Raynaud disease/Raynaud syndrome;
reactive arthritis, formerly Reiter disease, including Reiter arthritis; scleroderma
(systemic sclerosis); Sjögren syndrome; systemic lupus erythematosus; Takayasu
arteritis; granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis);
    familial Mediterranean fever; sarcoidosis, Lofgren syndrome </i><br>
  <b>Adverse effects of drugs on the immune system</b><br>
  <i>Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction; drugs affecting the immune system (eg, prednisone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, monoclonal antibody drugs [eg, abciximab, adalimumab; bevacizumab, infliximab, omalizumab, rituximab]); vaccine adverse effects</i><br>
