 A 36-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a cough of 4 weeks duration. The cough is paroxysmal, and he sometimes vomits after coughing. Two other people with whom he works have a similar cough. The patient works at a local automobile assembly plant; he is married with a 2-year-old child; and he has no history of cigarette smoking.<br>

On physical examination, the patient initially appears in no acute distress, then experiences a severe coughing attack, which leaves him weak and out of breath. Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) revealed a small conjunctival hemorrhage on the left, and several petechiae were noted on the face. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The remainder of the physical examination was benign.<br>

Laboratory studies were obtained, and the complete blood count (CBC) with differential showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8,000/ul with a normal differential. Posterior–anterior (PA) and lateral chest X-rays were also obtained and found to be normal.<br>

The physician obtains a nasopharyngeal aspirate that was sent to the microbiology laboratory for Gram stain and culture. An organism not typical for oral-pharyngeal flora and presumed to be the causative pathogen grew on Regan–Lowe agar after overnight incubation at 37°C. The Gram stain is shown in the following figure. A confirmatory direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of the organism isolated from the aspirate was also positive.<br>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> This case describes whooping cough, or Bordetella pertussis infection. B. pertussis is a fastidious gram-negative coccobacillus that primarily infects children and unvaccinated susceptible individuals. The presentation of pertussis is separated into three stages: the catarrhal phase, which appears as a typical upper respiratory tract infection; the paroxysmal phase, which presents with intense coughing jags and frequently the classic whooping sound of inspiration against a partially closed airway, post-tussive emesis is often seen; and the convalescent phase, which has a chronic cough that can last for weeks. In adults, particularly those who were previously immunized, the classic symptoms such as coughing paroxysms, the whooping sound, and post-tussive emesis may not be seen. The presence of the classic symptoms typically indicates an unvaccinated or undervaccinated individual. In children, a high WBC count (often > 20,000) is seen with a lymphocytosis frequently over 50%. Seeing a young child with a cough and high WBC with significant lymphocytosis is often a diagnostic clue for pertussis. In adults, however, the elevated WBC is rare, and lymphocytosis is generally not seen.<br>

B Haemophilus influenzae is incorrect because infections do not present with a paroxysmal cough, and H. influenzae are gram-negative bacilli.<br>

C Klebsiella pneumoniae is incorrect because infections do not present with a paroxysmal cough, and K. pneumoniae are gram-negative bacilli.<br>

D Legionella pneumophila is incorrect because they are rarely able to be visualized by Gram stain, and infections do not present with a paroxysmal cough.<br>

E Pseudomonas aeruginosa is incorrect because these infections are more often nosocomial or related to cystic fibrosis, which this patient does not have. Also, P. aeruginosa are gram-negative bacilli.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Transmission of B. pertussis from person-to-person occurs via aerosolized respiratory droplets. There are no identified animal or environmental reservoirs for this pathogen. Humans are the reservoir for B. pertussis.

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Activation of adenylate cyclase by disabling Gi (A)<br>

The virulence factors produced by B. pertussis include adherence to ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi via pili and filamentous hemagglutinin, endotoxin, pertussis toxin, hemolysin, adenylate cyclase toxin, and tracheal cytotoxin. Pertussis toxin is an A-B5 exotoxin that is secreted by a type IV secretion system and binds to the G-alpha inhibitory subunit inhibiting signal transduction, resulting in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and a subsequent increase in mucus production and death of the host cell. This mechanism of action of the pertussis toxin mimics adenylate cyclase activity.<br>

B Cleavage of circulating IgA is incorrect. The cleavage of IgA by bacterial proteases, such as in the case of H. influenzae, results in the impairment of antibody-induced entrapment of microbes in mucus secretions.<br>

C Inactivation of the 60S ribosome by cleavage of rRNA is incorrect. This describes the mechanism of action of Shiga toxin.<br>

D Toxin causing inactivation of host elongation factor 2 is incorrect. This describes the mechanism of action of P. aeruginosa exotoxin A.<br>

E Toxin that prevents the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter is incorrect. This describes the mechanism of action of Clostridium botulinum.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Subunit vaccine (E)

Prevention of infection is primarily by routine vaccination of infants, children, and adults. Though it was not mentioned explicitly, the patient was likely either unvaccinated or undervaccinated. Appropriate vaccination may have protected him from infection. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTap) vaccine in full strength is given to infants and children, while the reduced dose tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is offered to teens and adults. The current vaccine for pertussis is an acellular subunit vaccine, consisting of inactivated pertussis toxin ± filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae, and pertactin (adhesin). The current vaccine does not give lifelong immunity, and boosting in adults is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help prevent transmission to children.<br>

A DNA vaccine is incorrect. The pertussis vaccine is a subunit vaccine. There are no DNA vaccines approved for use in humans at present.<br>

B Killed whole cell vaccine is incorrect. The pertussis vaccine is a subunit vaccine. An example of a killed whole cell vaccine is the previous pertussis vaccine, which is no longer used in the United States.<br>

C Live attenuated vaccine is incorrect. The pertussis vaccine is a subunit vaccine. Example of a live attenuated vaccine is the MMR, nasal influenza, and chickenpox (varicella).<br>

D Recombinant vector vaccine is incorrect. The pertussis vaccine is a subunit vaccine. There are no recombinant vector vaccines approved for use in humans at present.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> The purpose of the antibiotic was not to treat the symptoms of the disease but to reduce transmission of the organism (D)<br>

Treatment of pertussis is generally supportive, particularly in very young children. Cough suppressants have little impact. Antibiotics generally have no impact on the duration of symptoms, though they may shorten the course and decrease the severity if given early in the catarrhal phase. Since pertussis is rarely diagnosed during the catarrhal phase, the addition of antibiotics is to eradicate the B. pertussis from the nasopharynx to reduce the spread of the infection (particularly in this case as this patient lives with a child at home and works in a populated environment). The antibiotic of choice is azithromycin (due to dosing schedule, bioavailability, and low side effect profile). Alternative antibiotics include clarithromycin, erythromycin, and for patients older than 2 months intolerant of macrolides, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) is a reasonable alternative. TMP–SMX should be avoided in children younger than 2 months due to risk for kernicterus. Azithromycin and erythromycin are both associated with an increased risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and it is unclear if such a risk exists for clarithromycin. Neither azithromycin nor clarithromycin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children younger than 6 months. Macrolide resistance is very uncommon, and antibiotic testing is generally not performed.<br>

A Azithromycin is not expected to clear this infection, but it was given because patients expect an antibiotic. This is incorrect because it is never correct to give an antibiotic just because a patient wants it.<br>

B Coinfection with a second organism is common in this disease, and it is likely that administration of a second antibiotic is warranted. This is incorrect because coinfection with a second organism is not common in this disease.<br>

C It is likely that the infection was resistant to azithromycin, and therapy will need to be altered. This is incorrect because azithromycin resistance is not commonly described in pertussis.<br>

E The standard dose of azithromycin was too low for this patient’s disease and the dose will need to be doubled. This is incorrect because a standard dose is all that is needed<Br>.</p>

  A mother brings her 6-year-old daughter to her pediatrician with symptoms of a sore throat and red, tearing eyes. The patient complains of itchy eyes when she woke up that morning. Her symptoms started the previous day, and she missed school today. History reveals that the child’s vaccinations are up to date and that she has been previously healthy with no prior hospitalizations. Upon examination, the patient is found to have a temperature of 39°C, blood pressure of 90/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. She has upper lid edema with slight subconjunctival hemorrhage. Her mother mentions that other classmates were also out sick during the past week with similar symptoms.<br>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Pharyngoconjunctivitis (D)<br>
This is a case of typical pharyngoconjunctivitis. It is highly infectious and usually is clinically identified by fever, pharyngitis, with enlarged lymph nodes in addition to conjunctivitis (pink eye). This infection is often observed in children. Because of its contagious nature, outbreaks often occur in schools, daycares, and dormitory settings. Swimming pool transmission has also been reported. The upper respiratory symptoms may precede or follow the ocular manifestations. The ocular symptoms may begin in one eye first with an itchy or gritty feeling and later becoming bilateral.<br>
A Allergic conjunctivitis is incorrect because these conditions are not associated with sore throat.<br>
B Gonococcal conjunctivitis is incorrect because the discharge from the eye is not purulent.<br>
C Keratoconjunctivitis is incorrect because there is no apparent corneal involvement in this case.<br>
E Endophthalmitis is incorrect because there is no apparent aqueous or vitreous involvement. It typically presents with decreasing vision and eye discomfort, neither of which describes this patient’s symptoms.<br></p>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Adenovirus (A)<br>
Adenovirus is the most common viral cause of conjunctivitis, but approximately 30% of all cases are due to a bacterial cause. In young children, it is estimated that 5 to 10% of all febrile illness are caused by adenoviruses. The genome of adenoviruses is composed of double-stranded DNA. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedron shape (see the following figure). It is common practice to diagnosis adenovirus pharyngoconjunctivitis by clinical presentation. However, definitive laboratory confirmation should be employed in order to best determine if antibiotics should be prescribed. The adenovirus infection is a self-limiting infection and should resolve within 2 weeks. During this period the person is still infectious.<br>
B HSV-1 is incorrect because it is less likely due to the presence of pharyngitis in this patient. HSV typically causes keratitis, which this patient does not have.<br>
C Neisseria gonorrhoeae is incorrect because this patient has no history of risk for N. gonorrhoeae infection.<br>
D Pseudomonas aeruginosa is incorrect because P. aeruginosa more commonly causes nosocomial infections and infections in patients with predisposing factors such as cystic fibrosis.<br>
E Staphylococcus aureus is incorrect because eye infections caused by S. aureus typically progress rapidly and are characterized by purulent discharge.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Droplet transmission (C)<br>
Adenovirus is a non-enveloped DNA virus and is relatively stable on environmental surfaces, surviving from days to months. Transmission occurs by inhalation of aerosolized droplets as well as fomites generated by hand-to-eye and fecal–oral routes. Transmission has occurred via recreational waters such as swimming pools and spas and is most likely a fecal–oral route, but secretions from eyes or throat can be a possible source. It is not spread via airborne transmission in small particles as is tuberculosis. Adenovirus has 50 serotypes grouped into seven subtypes: A to G. Neutralizing antibodies raised against one subtype do not provide immunity against virus of another subtype allowing for apparent reinfection.<br>
A Arthropod transmission is incorrect because adenovirus is not vector-borne.<br>
B Bloodborne transmission is incorrect because there is no history of blood exposure in this case, and adenovirus is not typically transmitted via the blood.<br>
D Foodborne transmission is incorrect because adenovirus is not food-borne.<br>
E Waterborne transmission is incorrect because while adenovirus can be transmitted through water, transmission was not by this method in this case.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (C)<br>

All of the listed answers are capable of being utilized in diagnosing pharyngoconjunctivitis. PCR is the best option both for specificity/sensitivity and turn-around-time and is commonly available as part of a respiratory viral panel performed on nasopharyngeal swabs.<br>
A While it is certainly commonplace to diagnose adenovirus by clinical presentation, misdiagnosis is possible and often leads to lack of antibiotic stewardship<br>.
B Cell culture is available for adenovirus detection, and the virus produces a characteristic cytopathic effect visible as cell clumping. However, culture of the virus may take 4 to 7 days for positive confirmation and therefore is rarely used. Shell vial culture (a modified version of traditional cell culture) and immunofluorescent detection can reduce confirmation to within 3 days.<br>
D Serology testing can detect exposure to adenovirus, but, as most young children are antibody positive by age 5, it has limited utility for diagnosis of acute infection. Serology is not the correct answer.<br>
E There is a point-of-care test that is available for screening adenovirus as a cause of conjunctivitis. However, a negative result does not rule out adenovirus as a cause, and other diagnostic measures should be employed.<Br></p>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Surgical mask and eye protection (C)

Since adenovirus is spread via droplets which are expelled by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking, the personal protective equipment needed to prevent the spread must include eye protection and a surgical mask.<br>
A Gowns and gloves are not enough to protect from the spread of this virus.<br>
B A N-95 mask would certainly prevent inhalation of adenovirus, but a mask with such a small weave is overkill for adenovirus, and using it without eye protection will not prevent droplets from infecting the health care worker via the conjunctiva.<br>
D, E There is no need to wash with dilute bleach to clean your hands as such measures will not inactivate this non-enveloped virus.<Br></p>
A 30-year-old construction worker from New Mexico with no significant past medical history was admitted to the hospital with severe shortness of breath. In the emergency room, he stated that he developed a cough in the past few days with fever, muscle aches, nausea, and vomiting. His wife reported that prior to his symptoms he was working overtime, renovating abandoned homes and she initially assumed he was feeling under the weather because he was working so much and not getting enough sleep.
<br>
On physical examination his temperature was 38.5°C, blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, heart rate was 140 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 75% on room air. A chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral diffuse opacities with Kerley B lines and peribronchial cuffing. His white blood cell count was 26,000 × 109/L with a predominance of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and noted atypical lymphocytes were observed. The patient’s platelet count was 75 with an elevated hematocrit level. A rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for influenza A is negative. He was admitted into the hospital and given supplemental oxygen but quickly transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated.<Br>

</form> 
Answer: <p style="color:white"> Hantavirus (B)<br>
This is a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) caused by genus Hantavirus in the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses. HPS is difficult to distinguish in the initial stages from the other respiratory infections; however, the history of exposure to rodent excreta should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis. A significant clue in this case is the location of New Mexico, as this is one of the Four Corners states, being New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. This is the region of the first outbreak of HPS in the United States of America in 1993 caused by the viral strain Sin Nombre virus (SNV). Since that time, other cases of HPS caused by other viral strains of hantavirus have been identified in other regions of the United States. The early symptoms of HPS are fatigue, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, cough, and high fever. These are thought to occur between 1 and 8 weeks after exposure. The late stage of HPS results in shortness of breath caused by the lungs filling with fluid. The virus infects microvascular endothelium resulting in deregulation of fluid accumulation. The fluid increase causes pulmonary edema and cardiac failure. There is 38% mortality in HPS cases.<br>
A While influenza A virus could present with similar symptoms, it is less likely due to the negative rapid PCR test.<br>
C Legionella pneumophila can present with similar symptoms but is often associated with exposure to an aerosolized water source such as a cooling tower or air conditioner. In addition, atypical lymphocytes are not normally seen with Legionella spp. infection.<br>
D Francisella tularensis is not likely because this patient was not exposed to common reservoirs such as rabbits. Pulmonary tularemia frequently presents with nodular infiltrates and pleural effusions.<br>
E EBV is not likely because although this patient has atypical lymphocytes, the other symptoms are not as commonly associated with EBV infection. EBV infection often presents with extreme fatigue.<br></p>

Hantavirus transmission occurs by inhalation of dried urine, saliva, or feces from infected rodents. The primary host of SNV is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus).<br>
A Hantavirus is not transmitted by birds. There are cases of bird-to-human transmission in the case of the H5N1 influenza A strain.<br>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Correct: Direct infection of the vascular endothelium of the lungs leading to pulmonary edema (A)<br>

Hantavirus antigens are primarily found in the endothelium of the capillaries throughout infected patients. Within the lungs this leads to inflammation and endothelial leakage causing pulmonary edema and a variation of acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br>

B Neutrophilic invasion of the lungs is typically seen with bacterial pneumonias.<br>

C Certain bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce toxins which can worsen pneumonia but generally are not the primary mode of pathogenesis.<br>

D Mucous plugging can be seen with a number of pulmonary conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<br>

E Buildup of protein along the alveolar walls is the pathogenesis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a rare noninfectious pulmonary syndrome.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (B)<Br>

The detection of Hantavirus infection is most often done by serological testing as the viral RNA disappears a few days after symptoms emerge. In the United States of America, the primary tests used are immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM ELISAs developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>

A Cell culture of the virus is difficult due to low viral production and requires biosafety level 3 management, whereas handling of serological specimens can be done under biosafety level 2 conditions.<br>

C Currently, there are not any FDA-approved commercial PCR assays available for Hantavirus screening.<br>

D While IgG and IgM can be assayed by Western blot, there is no Western blot available for Hantavirus. These tests use antibody created against recombinant viral N antigen. The viral N antigen is a structural protein that induces a strong antibody response.<Br>

E Gene-chip analysis is not available for clinical testing but is strictly used for research.<br></p>

Answer: <p style="color:white"> Supportive care only (E)<br>

Hantavirus has no specific treatment, so the only thing that can be done for a patient with HPS is to provide supportive care including fluids, pressors, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation if needed. Some studies advocate the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and quote survival rates of 66%.<br>

A A cidofovir would be of use for disseminated adenovirus but cidofovir is not of use for treatment of HPS.<br>

B Peramivir would potentially be of use for influenza A but has not been studied in severe cases.<br>

C Acyclovir is used in treating viruses of the herpes family including varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and has been used in the treatment of severe EBV, though the data to support this are mostly based on case reports and meta-analyses.<br>

D Doxycycline can be used to treat atypical pulmonary infections including Legionella; it has activity against Francisella, and it treats a number of tick-borne illnesses.<br></p>
