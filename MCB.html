  <i> Gene expression: DNA structure, replication, exchange, and epigenetics (eg, imprinting, X activation, DNA methylation)</i><br>
  <i> Gene expression: transcription<i> <br>
<i> Gene expression: translation, post-translational processing, modifications, and disposition of proteins (degradation), including protein/glycoprotein synthesis, intra-extracellular sorting, and processes/functions related to Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum </i><br>
<i>Structure and function of proteins and enzymes (eg, enzyme kinetics and structural/regulatory proteins)</i><br>
