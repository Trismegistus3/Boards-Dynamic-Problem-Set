  <b>Biochemistry and molecular biology</b><br>
  <i> Gene expression: DNA structure, replication, exchange, and epigenetics (eg, imprinting, X activation, DNA methylation)</i><br>
  <i> Gene expression: transcription<i> <br>
<i> Gene expression: translation, post-translational processing, modifications, and disposition of proteins (degradation), including protein/glycoprotein synthesis, intra-extracellular sorting, and processes/functions related to Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum </i><br>
<i>Structure and function of proteins and enzymes (eg, enzyme kinetics and structural/regulatory proteins)</i><br>
    <i> Energy metabolism (eg, ATP generation, transport chain)</i><br>
    <b> Biology of cells</b><br>
    <i> Adaptive cell responses and cellular homeostasis (eg, hypertrophy)</i><br>
    <i> Mechanisms of injury and necrosis, including pathologic processes (eg, liquefactive necrosis, free radical formation)</i><br>
    <i> Apoptosis</i>
    <i> Cell cycle and cell cycle regulation (eg, mitosis)</i><br>
    <i> Mechanisms of dysregulation</i><br>
    <i> Cell biology of cancer (eg, role of p53, proto-oncogenes)</i><br>
    <i> General principles of invasion and metastasis, including cancer staging</i> <br>
<i> Cell/tissue structure, regulation, and function, including cytoskeleton, organelles, glycolipids, channels, gap junctions, extracellular matrix, and receptors</i><br>
    <b>Human development and genetics</b><br>
    <i>Principles of pedigree analysis</i><br>

    <i> Acute inflammatory responses (patterns of response)</i><br>
    <i> Acute inflammation and mediator systems (eg, histamine, prostaglandins, bradykinins, eosinophilic basic protein, nitric oxide) </i><br>
    <i> Vascular response to injury, including mediators</i>
<i>Principles of cell adherence and migration (eg, ECAMs, selectins, leukocytic diapedesis, and rolling)</i><br>
    <i>Microbicidal mechanisms and tissue injury (eg, defensins)</i><br>
    <i>Clinical manifestations (eg, pain, fever, leukocytosis, leukemoid reaction, chills)</i><br>
    <i>Chronic inflammatory responses (eg, tumor necrosis factor)</i><br>
    <i>Reparative processes</i>
